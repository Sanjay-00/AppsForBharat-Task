###  SKU Performance

- **SKU_7** and **SKU_11** shine across all metrics â€” **high total revenue**, **high revenue per visit**, and **conversion rates above 54%**. These are your **hero SKUs**.
- **SKU_14** generates high revenue with **very low traffic**, making it an **underrated high-efficiency SKU** that could perform even better with more visibility.

---

### ðŸ“ˆ Cross-Cutting Trends

- **High revenue â‰  High conversion** â€” some SKUs generate strong revenue with low conversions, likely due to high price points (low volume, high value).
- **High store traffic doesnâ€™t guarantee high performance** â€” many high-traffic stores underperform, revealing **optimization gaps** in UX, inventory, or local relevance.

---

## Recommendations

### Double Down on High Performers

- **Scale Store_28, Store_33, Store_49** â€” these are highly efficient, high-revenue stores that can serve as blueprints for success.
- **Promote SKU_7 and SKU_11** through strategic campaigns and bundling to maximize ROI.
- **Increase visibility of SKU_14** to unlock more value from an already efficient product.

---

### Fix Underperformers Strategically

- **Audit Store_15, Store_9, Store_12, Store_17** for product assortment, UX, and layout issues to address low conversion and revenue.
- **Investigate SKU_5â€™s low revenue** despite high traffic â€” check product pricing, display, and checkout experience.
- **Re-evaluate SKU_19 and SKU_20** â€” consider removing or relaunching with a new angle.

---

### Strategic Optimizations

- For SKUs with **high conversions but low revenue**, implement **bundling and upselling**.
- For SKUs with **high revenue but low conversion**, consider **price optimization** or **user education via content**.
- **Improve store-level UX and targeting** for stores with high footfall but low sales.

## SKU-wise Conversion Analysis Across Stores

This section explores **how each SKU converts across different stores**.  
For each SKU, we plot its **Conversion Rate** per store to identify:

- Which stores are performing best for that specific SKU.
- Where the SKU is underperforming despite presence.

###  Key Points:

- Some SKUs may perform **exceptionally well in certain regions**, hinting at **store-level strengths** (e.g., local demand, staff expertise, display quality).
- Underperforming combinations could indicate **mismatch of product-market fit** at specific locations.
- For SKUs with **high variance across stores**, investigate **local factors** affecting conversion.
- Consider **store-specific marketing or layout changes** to improve performance of SKUs with low conversion in certain stores.
